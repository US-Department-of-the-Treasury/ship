## What is Ship?

Ship is a project management tool that combines documentation, issue tracking, and sprint planning in one place. Instead of switching between a wiki, a task tracker, and a spreadsheet, everything lives together.

**Built by the U.S. Department of the Treasury** for government teams, but useful for any organization that wants to work more effectively.

---

## How to Use Ship

Ship has four main views, each designed for different questions:

| View | What it answers |
|------|-----------------|
| **Docs** | "Where's that document?" — Wiki-style pages for team knowledge |
| **Issues** | "What needs to be done?" — Track tasks, bugs, and features |
| **Projects** | "What are we building?" — Group issues into deliverables |
| **Teams** | "Who's doing what?" — See workload across people and sprints |

### The Basics

1. **Create documents** for anything your team needs to remember — meeting notes, specs, onboarding guides
2. **Create issues** for work that needs to get done — assign them to people and track progress
3. **Group issues into projects** to organize related work
4. **Plan sprints** to decide what to work on in the next two weeks

Everyone on the team can edit documents at the same time. You'll see other people's cursors as they type.

---

## The Ship Philosophy

### Everything is a Document

In Ship, there's no difference between a "wiki page" and an "issue" at the data level. They're all documents with different properties. This means:

- You can link any document to any other document
- Issues can have rich content, not just a title and description
- Projects and sprints are documents too — they can contain notes, decisions, and context

### Sprints Follow the Scientific Method

Ship treats each sprint as an experiment:

1. **Hypothesis (Sprint Plan)** — Before the sprint, write down what you plan to do and what you expect to happen
2. **Experiment (The Sprint)** — Do the work
3. **Conclusion (Sprint Retro)** — After the sprint, write down what actually happened and what you learned

This isn't paperwork for paperwork's sake. Teams that skip retrospectives repeat the same mistakes. Teams that write things down learn and improve.

### Learning, Not Compliance

Documentation requirements in Ship are visible but not blocking. You can start a new sprint without finishing the last retro. But the system makes missing documentation obvious — it shows up as a visual indicator that escalates from yellow to red over time.

The goal isn't to check boxes. It's to capture what your team learned so you can get better.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or newer
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for the database)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/US-Department-of-the-Treasury/ship.git
cd ship

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Configure environment
cp api/.env.example api/.env.local

# 4. Start the database
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Create sample data
pnpm db:seed

# 6. Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# 7. Start the application
pnpm dev
```

### Open the App

Once it's running, open your browser to:

**http://localhost:5173**

Log in with the demo account:
- **Email:** `dev@ship.local`
- **Password:** `admin123`

### What's Running

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Web app | http://localhost:5173 | The Ship interface |
| API server | http://localhost:3000 | Backend services |
| Swagger UI | http://localhost:3000/api/docs | Interactive API documentation |
| OpenAPI spec | http://localhost:3000/api/openapi.json | OpenAPI 3.0 specification |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 | Database (via Docker) |

### Common Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start everything
pnpm dev:web      # Start just the web app
pnpm dev:api      # Start just the API
pnpm db:seed      # Reset database with sample data
pnpm db:migrate   # Run database migrations
pnpm test         # Run tests
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture

Ship is a monorepo with three packages:

- **web/** — React frontend with TipTap editor for real-time collaboration
- **api/** — Express backend with WebSocket support
- **shared/** — TypeScript types used by both

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React, Vite, TailwindCSS |
| Editor | TipTap + Yjs (real-time collaboration) |
| Backend | Express, Node.js |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Real-time | WebSocket |

### Design Decisions

- **Everything is a document** — Single `documents` table with a `document_type` field
- **Server is truth** — Offline-tolerant, syncs when reconnected
- **Boring technology** — Well-understood tools over cutting-edge experiments
- **E2E testing** — 73+ Playwright tests covering real user flows

See [docs/application-architecture.md](docs/application-architecture.md) for more.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pnpm test

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:ui

# Run specific test file
pnpm test e2e/documents.spec.ts
```

Ship uses Playwright for end-to-end testing with 73+ tests covering all major functionality.
