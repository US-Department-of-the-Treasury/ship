# Performance Management: Weekly Plan & Retro Cycle

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Writing your plan:**
- [ ] Every item has a verifiable outcome (not just an activity)
- [ ] Each deliverable produces something observable: a document, a metric, a shipped feature
- [ ] 3-5 significant items for the week (not too few, not too granular)
- [ ] Someone unfamiliar with your work could tell if each item was done

**Writing your retro:**
- [ ] Every plan item is addressed (completed or explained)
- [ ] Completed items include evidence (links, screenshots, or the deliverable itself)
- [ ] Incomplete items explain what happened and why
- [ ] No plan items are silently ignored

**For managers reviewing:**
- [ ] Each plan item is verifiable — could you confirm completion from evidence alone?
- [ ] Workload is reasonable for a full work week
- [ ] Retro evidence matches plan commitments
- [ ] Incomplete items have genuine explanations (not excuses)

## 1. Overview

Ship uses a weekly plan-and-retro cycle to keep teams aligned, accountable, and continuously improving. The cycle works like this:

1. **Plan** — Before the week starts, each person writes what they will deliver this week
2. **Review** — Managers review plans, approving them or requesting changes
3. **Execute** — The team works toward their commitments
4. **Retro** — After the week ends, each person writes what they actually delivered, with evidence
5. **Rate** — Managers review retros, provide a performance rating, and close the loop

This creates a tight feedback cycle: commit to deliverables, execute, prove you delivered, get rated on results. Over time, people get better at planning realistic weeks and delivering measurable outcomes.

## 2. The Weekly Cadence

Each week follows a fixed schedule:

| Phase | Window | What Happens |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Plan** | Saturday - Monday | Write your plan for the upcoming week |
| **Plan Review** | Monday - Tuesday | Manager reviews and approves (or requests changes) |
| **Execute** | Monday - Friday | Work on your committed deliverables |
| **Retro** | Thursday - Saturday | Write your retro with evidence of delivery |
| **Retro Review** | Friday - Monday | Manager reviews retro and assigns performance rating |

**Plans are forward-looking commitments.** They answer: "What will I deliver this week?"

**Retros are backward-looking evidence.** They answer: "What did I actually deliver, and can I prove it?"

The system notifies you when plans and retros are due. If items are overdue, the notification becomes more urgent.

## 3. Writing a Good Weekly Plan

### The Core Principle: Verifiable Deliverables

Every item in your plan should have a **clear, verifiable outcome**. An independent observer — someone who knows nothing about your day-to-day — should be able to determine whether the item was completed just by looking at evidence.

Ask yourself: **"If my manager asked to see the result, what would I show them?"**

If the answer is "nothing tangible," the plan item needs to be rewritten.

### Examples

| Status | Plan Item | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Bad | "Coordinate with engineering team" | No verifiable outcome. What does "coordinate" produce? |
| Good | "Deliver draft API specification to engineering lead" | Clear deliverable (a document) with a clear recipient |
| | | |
| Bad | "Investigate deployment options" | No deliverable. Investigating is an activity, not an outcome. |
| Good | "Write comparison memo of 3 deployment options with recommendation" | Produces a specific document with defined scope |
| | | |
| Bad | "Meet with stakeholders" | A meeting is an activity. What comes out of it? |
| Good | "Document stakeholder requirements in shared wiki page" | Produces a specific artifact from the meeting |
| | | |
| Bad | "Recruit engineers" | Not verifiable. How would you measure this? |
| Good | "Conduct 30 screening calls with engineering candidates" | Specific, measurable, and indicates meaningful volume |
| | | |
| Bad | "Work on the budget" | Vague. What part? To what end? |
| Good | "Deliver final budget report to CFO by Thursday" | Clear deliverable, clear deadline, clear recipient |
| | | |
| Bad | "Improve website performance" | No clear definition of done |
| Good | "Reduce homepage load time from 3.2s to under 1.5s" | Measurable target with specific numbers |

### The Pattern

Most bad plan items fall into one of these traps:

1. **Activities instead of outcomes** — "Meet with," "coordinate with," "work on" describe what you'll *do*, not what you'll *produce*
2. **Vague scope** — "Improve X," "investigate Y" have no definition of done
3. **No evidence possible** — If you can't imagine what "proof of completion" looks like, the item isn't specific enough

Most good plan items follow this pattern:
> **[Verb that produces something] + [specific deliverable] + [for whom / by when]**

Examples: "Deliver," "write," "ship," "publish," "submit," "complete," "conduct [N]"

### Workload Expectations

A reasonable week for a full-time employee includes **3-5 significant deliverables** or equivalent effort.

- **Too few items** (1-2) suggests under-commitment or items that are too large. Break them down.
- **Too many items** (8+) suggests the items are too granular. Group related tasks into meaningful deliverables.
- **Right-sized items** represent a full day or two of focused work each.

Consider the total volume of work, not just the count. "Conduct 5 screening calls" is very different from "Conduct 50 screening calls" — the first is a light week, the second is substantial. Both are verifiable, but only one represents a full week of effort.

### AI Quality Assistant

The system provides AI-powered feedback on your plan as you write it. You'll see:

- A **quality meter** showing the likelihood your plan will be approved (red/yellow/green)
- **Per-item feedback** explaining what's strong and what could be improved
- A **workload assessment** indicating whether your week looks light, moderate, or heavy

**This feedback is advisory, not a gate.** You can submit your plan at any quality level. The AI is a coaching tool to help you write better plans — it does not block your submission. Think of it as a spell-checker for plan quality: you can ignore the suggestions, but your manager might catch the same issues.

## 4. Writing a Good Weekly Retro

### Connect Every Item to Your Plan

Your retro should address **every item from your plan**. For each plan item:

**If you completed it:** Provide evidence. This can be:
- A link to the document, PR, or artifact you produced
- A screenshot showing the result
- The deliverable itself embedded in your retro (drag and drop)
- Specific quantitative results ("Completed 32 screening calls — see calendar export attached")

**If you didn't complete it:** Explain what happened. Valid explanations include:
- "Project X took longer than expected because of [specific reason], so I didn't start on project Y this week"
- "Reprioritized mid-week because [urgent thing] came up — see the updated plan"
- "Blocked by [dependency] — escalated to [person] on Wednesday, waiting for resolution"

**What's not acceptable:** Silently ignoring a plan item. If your plan said you'd do something and your retro doesn't mention it at all, your manager will flag it.

### It's OK to Not Deliver Everything

Priorities change. Blockers emerge. Scope shifts. That's normal. The point isn't to deliver 100% of your plan every week — it's to be **transparent about what happened and why**.

A retro that says "I delivered 3 of 5 items because items 4 and 5 were deprioritized when the security incident required all hands" is perfectly fine. It might affect your rating for that week, but it's honest and accountable.

A retro that just lists 3 items and pretends the other 2 never existed is not acceptable.

### AI Quality Assistant

The retro quality assistant checks your retro against your plan and provides feedback:

- A **completeness meter** showing what percentage of plan items you've addressed
- A **plan coverage checklist** showing which items are addressed, which have evidence, and which are missing
- **Suggestions** like "Your manager will ask for evidence that this was delivered — consider adding a link or screenshot"

Like the plan assistant, this is **advisory only**. It does not block your retro submission. But addressing its suggestions before submitting will reduce the likelihood of your manager requesting changes.

## 5. The Manager Review Process

Managers review plans and retros using the Reviews page. For each item, three actions are available:

### Approve

The plan or retro meets quality standards. For plans, this means the deliverables are specific, verifiable, and represent a reasonable week of work. For retros, this means plan items are addressed with adequate evidence.

### Request Changes

Something needs revision. When requesting changes, the manager provides specific feedback explaining what needs to be fixed. Common reasons include:

- "Your plan items are too vague — 'coordinate with team' needs a specific deliverable"
- "Missing evidence for item 3 — please attach the memo or link to it"
- "You didn't address items 4 and 5 from your plan — please explain what happened"

When changes are requested:
1. The employee receives a notification (banner alert)
2. The employee opens their plan/retro and sees the manager's feedback
3. The employee makes revisions
4. The manager reviews again and either approves or requests further changes

This cycle continues until the manager approves. It mirrors the code review process: submit, get feedback, revise, get approved.

### Skip

Defer review to later. No state change occurs — the item stays in "needs review" status. Use this when you need more time or context before making a decision.

## 6. Performance Ratings (Retros Only)

When approving a retro, managers assign a performance rating using the OPM 5-level scale:

| Rating | Label | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Outstanding | Exceptional performance far exceeding expectations |
| 4 | Exceeds Expectations | Performance clearly above the fully successful level |
| 3 | Fully Successful | Solid performance meeting all expectations |
| 2 | Minimally Satisfactory | Performance barely meeting minimum requirements |
| 1 | Unacceptable | Performance failing to meet minimum requirements |

Ratings reflect:
- **Were commitments met?** Did the employee deliver what they planned?
- **Quality of deliverables** — Were the outputs high-quality and complete?
- **Accountability for gaps** — Were incomplete items honestly explained?
- **Volume and impact** — Was this a productive, meaningful week?

Ratings are visible to the employee, creating a transparent feedback loop. Over time, weekly ratings build a performance trend that informs longer-term evaluations.

## 7. AI Quality Assistant

The system uses AI to provide real-time coaching on plan and retro quality. Here's what it does and doesn't do:

### What It Does

**For plans:**
- Evaluates each item for verifiability — can someone tell if it was done?
- Assesses workload — does this represent a full week of meaningful work?
- Provides specific improvement suggestions with rewrite examples
- Shows an overall approval likelihood score

**For retros:**
- Checks coverage — does the retro address every plan item?
- Evaluates evidence — are completed items backed by proof?
- Flags gaps — are incomplete items explained?
- Provides guidance on improving retro quality

### What It Doesn't Do

- **Does not block submission.** You can submit a plan or retro regardless of AI feedback.
- **Does not replace manager judgment.** The AI provides guidance; your manager makes the final call.
- **Does not penalize you.** Low AI scores have no direct consequences — they're coaching signals.
- **Does not share your content.** Analysis happens within the system's infrastructure.

### How to Use It

Think of the AI assistant as a pre-flight checklist. Before you submit:

1. Check the quality meter — is it green? If not, review the suggestions.
2. Look at per-item feedback — are any items flagged as vague or unverifiable?
3. Check the workload assessment — does your week look appropriately full?
4. Address what makes sense, ignore what doesn't. Use your judgment.

The goal is to help you write plans and retros that pass review on the first try, reducing back-and-forth with your manager.
