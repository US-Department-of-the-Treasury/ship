# Ship Accountability Philosophy

This document explains Ship's approach to accountability and why it matters for effective team execution.

> **Related**: See [Ship Philosophy](./ship-philosophy.md) for the overall system design and [Week Documentation Philosophy](./week-documentation-philosophy.md) for week-specific details.

## Why Accountability

Accountability is often confused with blame. In Ship, accountability means **clarity about who is responsible for outcomes** and **visibility into whether commitments are being met**.

Without accountability:
- Deadlines slip and nobody knows why
- Documentation is always "almost done"
- Retros get skipped because "we're too busy"
- Teams repeat the same mistakes week after week

With accountability:
- Clear ownership means clear expectations
- Missing documentation is visible, not hidden
- Learning happens because reflection is required
- Teams improve over time

**The goal isn't punishment. The goal is learning.**

## Hypothesis-Driven Development

Ship treats every project and week as a scientific experiment:

1. **Hypothesis**: Before starting, write down what you expect to happen
2. **Experiment**: Execute the work
3. **Conclusion**: Document what actually happened

This isn't bureaucracy—it's how teams learn.

### Why Hypotheses Matter

Teams that skip hypotheses:
- Start work without clear success criteria
- Can't tell if they succeeded or failed
- Declare "partial success" on everything
- Never know if their intuition is right

Teams that write hypotheses:
- Know exactly what success looks like
- Can objectively measure outcomes
- Build pattern recognition over time
- Get better at estimation and planning

### Binary Validation

Ship forces binary outcomes: **validated** or **invalidated**. There is no "partially validated."

This prevents:
- Moving goalposts after the fact
- Rationalizing failures as successes
- Avoiding accountability through ambiguity

If a hypothesis is invalidated, that's valuable information. Learning why something didn't work is often more valuable than accidentally succeeding.

## The Standup Ritual

Standups in Ship are asynchronous written updates. They serve three purposes:

### 1. Progress Visibility

Written standups create a searchable record of what's happening. Anyone can see:
- What work was completed
- What's planned next
- What blockers exist

This eliminates the "I didn't know that was happening" problem.

### 2. Personal Accountability

Writing down your commitments creates psychological accountability. It's harder to let things slip when you've publicly stated what you're going to do.

### 3. Cross-Time-Zone Collaboration

Unlike synchronous standups, written updates work for distributed teams. Someone in Tokyo and someone in New York can both participate without anyone waking up at 3am.

### Standup Frequency

Ship encourages regular standups but doesn't enforce a specific frequency. However:
- Week owners have a responsibility to ensure their team is posting updates
- Prolonged silence is visible and creates accountability
- The system shows when the last standup was posted

## Weekly Reviews and Retros

Weeks end with two documents that close the learning loop:

### Weekly Review (Weekly)

A weekly review answers: **What did we actually deliver?**

- Issues completed vs. planned
- What carried over to next week
- Any scope changes or surprises

This is execution tracking—did we do what we said we'd do?

### Weekly Retro (Weekly)

A weekly retro answers: **What did we learn?**

- What worked well?
- What should we change?
- Are our estimates improving?

This is process improvement—are we getting better over time?

### Project Retro (End of Project)

A project retro answers: **Was the hypothesis validated?**

- Did we achieve the stated outcome?
- What was the actual impact vs. expected?
- What should the next team know?

This is outcome measurement—did the bet pay off?

## RACI Assignments

Ship uses the RACI model for clear accountability:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **R** - Responsible | Does the work |
| **A** - Accountable | Approves and is answerable for the outcome |
| **C** - Consulted | Provides input before decisions |
| **I** - Informed | Kept up to date on progress |

### Why RACI Matters

The most important distinction is **Responsible vs. Accountable**:

- **Responsible (Owner)**: The person doing the work. A project can have multiple contributors, but one person owns it.
- **Accountable (Approver)**: The person who must approve key decisions. Usually a manager, tech lead, or senior stakeholder.

Without this distinction:
- Work gets done but never reviewed
- Quality varies wildly
- Senior input happens too late to matter
- Nobody feels ownership of outcomes

### What Gets Approved

In Ship, the Accountable person must approve:

| Document | What's Approved |
|----------|-----------------|
| Week | Hypothesis (before week starts) |
| Week | Review (after week ends) |
| Project | Hypothesis (before project starts) |
| Project | Retrospective (after project ends) |

Approval creates:
- **Quality gates**: Work is reviewed before it's considered complete
- **Teaching moments**: Approvers can provide feedback
- **Audit trail**: Who approved what, when

## How Ship Enforces Accountability

Ship doesn't block work for missing documentation. Instead, it makes gaps visible and escalates urgency over time.

### Visual Indicators

Missing documentation shows as status indicators:
- **Gray**: Not yet due
- **Yellow**: Should be done soon
- **Red**: Overdue and needs attention

These indicators appear:
- In the week list
- On project cards
- In the accountability grid (for managers)

### Action Items on Login

When a user has overdue accountability items (missed standups, unapproved hypotheses, missing retros), Ship:

1. Shows a modal on login listing all pending items
2. Displays a persistent banner until items are addressed
3. Links directly to each item for quick action

This creates gentle but persistent pressure to complete accountability tasks.

### Auto-Generated Issues

For severely overdue items (7+ days), Ship can automatically create issues:
- Assigned to the responsible party
- Linked to the overdue week or project
- Visible to the entire team

This escalates accountability from "soft reminder" to "tracked work item."

### The Accountability Grid

Managers see an accountability grid showing:
- All team members
- Their pending accountability items
- Days overdue for each item

This enables proactive management conversations rather than surprise discoveries during reviews.

## Philosophy Summary

Ship's accountability system is built on these principles:

1. **Visibility over blocking**: Make gaps obvious, don't prevent work
2. **Escalating urgency**: Start soft, get more insistent over time
3. **People own outcomes**: Only humans can be accountable
4. **Learning is the goal**: Accountability enables improvement
5. **Binary validation**: No partial success, no ambiguity

The system is intentionally "noisy." It's supposed to create friction when accountability slips. This is a feature, not a bug.

Teams that embrace the friction improve over time. Teams that resist it stay stuck.
