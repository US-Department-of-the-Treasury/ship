## Completed PRDs

### 1. Unified Document Routing (12/12 stories)
**Impact:** Major architectural change unifying all document access patterns

All document types now use `/documents/:id` as the canonical route:
- `/docs/:id`, `/projects/:id`, `/programs/:id`, `/sprints/:id` redirect to `/documents/:id`
- Rail highlighting based on `document_type` field, not URL
- Sidebar shows type-appropriate list for each document
- Sprint tabs: Overview, Plan, Review, Standups
- Back navigation returns to correct list page (e.g., project → /projects)
- Removed 5 legacy page components (cleaner codebase)

### 2. Reusable Issues List Component (15/15 stories)
**Impact:** Standardized issue management across all contexts

- Extracted reusable `IssuesList` component with bulk actions
- Checkbox selection persists across navigation
- Undo support for bulk operations (5-second window)
- URL-synced filters with namespaced query params
- Context inheritance (new issues auto-linked to project/sprint)
- Deprecated legacy `project_id`/`sprint_id` fields in favor of `belongs_to[]` array

### 3. Document Tab Deep Linking (5/5 stories)
**Impact:** Shareable URLs for specific document tabs

- URL-driven tab state (`/documents/:id/:tab`)
- Configuration-based tab registry by document type
- Invalid tab redirects to clean URL
- Sprint planning tabs accessible via URL

### 4. Project-Centric Sprint Planning (12/12 stories)
**Impact:** Improved sprint workflow

- Sprint review entry points with badges
- Historical week picker for My Week view
- Sprint close reconciliation prompts
- In-app standup due indicators
- Guided project creation wizard

## Claude/Ship Integration Enhancements

### Ship Skill Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/ship:status` | Sprint dashboard with progress metrics |
| `/ship:standup` | AI-assisted standup posting from git activity |
| `/ship:issue` | Create issues with context awareness |
| `/ship:review` | Sprint review with pre-fill from Ship data |
| `/ship:wiki` | Create/update wiki pages |
| `/ship:retro` | Project retrospective guidance |
| `/ship:auth` | Authenticate Claude Code with Ship API |

**Command Details:**

- **`/ship:status`** - Fetches current sprint, calculates velocity metrics, shows issues by state (todo/in_progress/in_review/done), displays recent standups. Useful for daily check-ins.

- **`/ship:standup`** - Analyzes `git log` since last standup, correlates commits to issues, drafts intelligent standup update with "Yesterday/Today/Blockers" format, posts to current sprint.

- **`/ship:issue`** - Creates issues with automatic context inheritance. If invoked from a project directory with `ship_project_id` in PRD, auto-links to that project. Supports priority, tags, and assignment.

- **`/ship:review`** - Pre-fills sprint review from Ship data: completed issues, velocity stats, hypothesis validation status. Human edits and submits.

- **`/ship:wiki`** - Creates or updates wiki documents in Ship. Converts markdown to TipTap JSON format. Useful for documentation, changelogs, and decision records.

### The /work Workflow (PRD Execution Loop)

The `/work` command executes PRDs using an enforced validation loop. It runs until ALL user stories pass, then performs post-completion tasks.

#### PRD Structure with Ship Integration

```json
{
  "name": "feature-name",
  "ship_project_id": "uuid-of-ship-project",
  "ship_issue_ids": {
    "story-1-id": "ship-issue-uuid-1",
    "story-2-id": "ship-issue-uuid-2"
  },
  "confidence": 70,
  "userStories": [...],
  "feedbackLoops": {
    "type_check": "pnpm type-check",
    "test": "pnpm test",
    "build": "pnpm build"
  }
}
```

#### Execution Phases

**Phase 1: Initialization**
1. Locate PRD file in `plans/` directory
2. Create/resume progress file (`{name}-progress.txt`)
3. Setup ralph loop (stop hook prevents exit until complete)
4. Check Ship connection and replay any queued operations
5. Display status: X/Y stories passing

**Phase 2: Iteration Loop** (repeats until all stories pass)

```

**Philosophy:** Claude completes implementation and moves to `in_review`. Human developer validates and approves before `done`. This ensures quality control and human oversight.

#### Telemetry Captured Per Story

```json
{
  "iterations": 3,
  "feedback_loops": {
    "type_check": 5,
    "test": 4,
    "build": 2
  },
  "time_elapsed_seconds": 1847,
  "files_changed": ["src/components/Foo.tsx", "src/lib/bar.ts"],
  "confidence": 80
}
```

#### Confidence Tracking

- **Initial:** From PRD `confidence` field (default: 70)
- **On verification failure:** -10 (minimum 0)
- **On story success:** +10 (maximum 100)
- **Stored:** In Ship issue `claude_metadata.confidence`
- **Aggregated:** Project-level confidence updated after each story

#### Blocker Issue Creation

When verification fails and a blocker is identified:
1. Claude asks: "Create blocker issue in Ship?"
2. If yes: Creates issue with `blocker` tag, high priority
3. Links to project via `belongs_to[]`
4. Blocker appears in sprint planning view

---

### Offline Queue Support

Ship API calls are queued when the connection fails:

```
~/.claude/ship-queue.jsonl
```

**Queued Operations:**
- `update_issue_state` - State transitions (in_progress, in_review)
- `create_issue_iteration` - Iteration logs
- `log_verification_failure` - Failed verification attempts
- `update_project_confidence` - Confidence updates
- `create_blocker` - Blocker issue creation

**Queue Replay:**
- Automatic on `/work` initialization if Ship is reachable
- Manual via `ship_queue_replay` function
- Preserves order and prevents data loss

---

### Progress File Format

Each PRD has a companion progress file (`{name}-progress.txt`):

```markdown
# Progress Log
PRD: plans/feature-name.prd.json
Started: 2026-01-21T10:00:00Z

---

## Iteration 1 - story-title
- Completed: Implemented X feature
- Files changed: src/A.tsx, src/B.ts
- Learnings: Found pattern Y useful
- Next: story-2-title

## Iteration 2 - story-2-title
...
```

**Purpose:**
- Survives context compaction (Claude re-reads on resume)
- Audit trail of implementation decisions
- Learnings extraction for future PRDs

---

## API & Backend Changes

### Performance Improvements
- Fixed N+1 queries in issues endpoint
- Fixed N+1 query in standups `transformIssueLinks`
- Configured PostgreSQL connection pooling for production

### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/sprints/:id/start` - Start a planning sprint
- Sprint review pre-fill with issues data
- Issue-level iteration tracking

### Bug Fixes
- Case-insensitive email matching in invite acceptance
- PIV login duplicate person document prevention
- Yjs WebSocket provider cleanup race condition
- AbortSignal support for file uploads (cancellation)
- Circular reference protection for `parent_id`

### Testing
- 34 session timeout test cases
- WebSocket collaboration tests
- Comprehensive API route tests (auth, issues, sprints)
- Lock-the-door tests for selection persistence

---

## Infrastructure

### WAF & Security
- Terraform-managed WAF rules
- CloudFront logging enabled
- AWSManagedRulesAntiDDoSRuleSet integration

### Deployment
- Shadow environment support for UAT
- Auto-run terraform apply if S3 bucket not found
- Environment-specific terraform files gitignored

---

## UI/UX Improvements

- Scroll breathing room on all scrollable containers
- Drag-and-drop for non-image file attachments
- Auto-focus title input on new documents
- Allocation page header transparency fix
- In-place document type conversion with undo

---

## Data Model Evolution

### Multi-Association Architecture
Issues now support multiple associations via `belongs_to[]` array:
```json
{
  "belongs_to": [
    {"id": "project-uuid", "type": "project"},
    {"id": "sprint-uuid", "type": "sprint"}
  ]
}
```

Benefits:
- Issues can belong to multiple sprints (carry-over support)
- Sub-issues with unlimited depth
- Cleaner API for association management

### Deprecated Fields
- `project_id` → Use `belongs_to[]` with type: "project"
- `sprint_id` → Use `belongs_to[]` with type: "sprint"

---

## Security Review Notes

All changes passed security review:
- Routes properly authenticated via `ProtectedRoute`
- Authorization checks via `canAccessDocument()`
- CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- Parameterized SQL queries (no injection vulnerabilities)
- No hardcoded secrets

---

## Known Issues

1. **Pre-existing test failure**: `sprint-reviews.test.ts` - Test expects issues in pre-fill but test setup doesn't link issues correctly. Unrelated to new changes.

---

## What's Next

- **My Work Dashboard PRD**: 10 stories planned (personal task aggregation)
- Shadow deployment for UAT before merge to production
- E2E test coverage for new routing patterns
