## Iteration 1 - Include due-today items in accountability checks
- Completed: Changed date comparison from > to >= in checkWeeklyPersonAccountability for both weekly_plan (line 390) and weekly_retro (line 418). Added has_overdue and has_due_today boolean flags to the /api/accountability/action-items response. Updated ActionItemsResponse type in frontend hook.
- Files changed: api/src/services/accountability.ts, api/src/routes/accountability.ts, web/src/hooks/useActionItemsQuery.ts
- Learnings: Pre-existing test failures due to audit_log deletion constraint in test setup - not related to our changes.
- Next: banner-urgency-colors (high priority, depends on this story)


## Iteration 2 - Banner shows yellow for due-today, red for overdue
- Completed: Added urgency prop to AccountabilityBanner ('overdue' | 'due_today'). Banner uses bg-amber-600/bg-amber-800 for due-today, bg-red-600/bg-red-800 for overdue. Updated App.tsx to compute urgency from actionItemsData.has_overdue flag. Celebration banner (green) unaffected.
- Files changed: web/src/components/AccountabilityBanner.tsx, web/src/pages/App.tsx
- Learnings: None - straightforward prop threading.
- Next: e2e-tests (medium priority, depends on this story)
